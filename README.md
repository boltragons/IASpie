# Objective

The main objective is to facilitate learning on the subject of Computer Architecture and Organization through the use of programming for the IAS computer, using mnemonic instructions, similar to Assembly, as an introduction.

The use of the IAS computer is interesting in learning computer architectures, but its programming is complicated, mainly due to the use of numeric opcodes for this. This project brings a relatively powerful and simple assembler, which will assist in learning, through mnemonic instructions.

# Manual

This programm was compiled in a Ubuntu 20.04, therefore it will only run in a linux-based kernel. To run in other kernel you must compile it. In the root directory do:

```
make it
```

The binary will me in bin/ folder. Then, you must run it with at least one parameter, up to two, in the following fashion:

```
./bin/iaspie input.ias output.txt
```

Where "input.ias" is the file with the IASlang mnemonics, you must put this, where the extension must be ".ias", and "output.txt" is the file where the opcodes will be placed, an optional parameter. Done this you can test the program in the following simulator. Place the generated code in the box, press the load button and run it.

<a href="https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~edson/disciplinas/mc404/2017-2s/abef/IAS-sim/">IAS Simulator</a>

There are 22 instructions, as showed bellow. There are some restraints: all procedures must begin with "\_" and end with a ":". All variable labels must, as well, end with ":". You can write one line commentaries with "#". The variables must be placed in data section, thats it, bellow the diretive ".data", anda the instructions must be placed in the code section, bellow ".code". The data sextion must be bellow the coode section. 

This initial programm version accept up to 10 procedures and 232 variables.

| Opcode | Instruction Type | Mnemonic | Operation | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0x00 | Exit | HALT | - | Halt the program execution. Will abort the simulator with "invalidInstruction" exception. |
| 0x01 | Data Transfer | LDM mem | LOAD M(x) | Load variable <i>mem</i> to <i>AC</i> register. |
| 0x02 | Data Transfer | LDMn mem | LOAD -M(x) | Load variable negative <i>mem</i> to <i>AC</i> register. | 
| 0x03 | Data Transfer | LDMa mem | LOAD \|M(x)\| | Load variable module <i>mem</i> to <i>AC</i> register. | 
| 0x04 | Data Transfer | LDMan mem | LOAD -\|M(x)\| | Load variable negative module <i>mem</i> to <i>AC</i> register. | 
| 0x05 | Arithmetic | ADD mem | ADD M(x) | Add variable <i>mem</i> to <i>AC</i> register. | 
| 0x06 | Arithmetic | SUB mem | SUB M(x) | Sub variable <i>mem</i> to <i>AC</i> register. | 
| 0x07 | Arithmetic | ADDa mem | ADD \|M(x)\| | Add the module of variable <i>mem</i> to <i>AC</i> register. | 
| 0x08 | Arithmetic | SUBa mem | SUB \|M(x)\| | Sub the module of variable <i>mem</i> to <i>AC</i> register. |
| 0x09 | Data Transfer | LDA mem | LOAD MQ, M(x) | Load variable <i>mem</i> to <i>MQ</i> register. | 
| 0x0A | Data Transfer | LDQ | LOAD MQ | Load <i>MQ</i> register to <i>AC</i> register. |
| 0x0B | Arithmetic | MUL mem | MUL M(x) | Multiply variable <i>mem</i> by <i>MQ</i> register. The most significant bit will be in AC and the least in MQ. |
| 0x0C | Arithmetic | DIV mem | DIV M(x) | Divide <i>AC</i> register by variable <i>mem</i>. The quocient will be in MQ and the remainder in AC. |
| 0x0D | Unconditional Branch | JMPT proc | JUMP M(x, 0:19) | Branch to the first instruction of the <i>proc</i> procedure. |
| 0x0E | Unconditional Branch | JMPB proc | JUMP M(x, 20:39) | Branch to the second instruction of the <i>proc</i> procedure.|
| 0x0F | Conditional Branch | JMPTs proc | JUMP+ M(x, 0:19) | Branch to the first instruction of the <i>proc</i> procedure if <i>AC</i> is nonnegative. | 
| 0x10 | Conditional Branch | JMPBs proc | JUMP+ M(x, 20:39) | Branch to the second instruction of the <i>proc</i> procedure if <i>AC</i> is nonnegative. |
| 0x12 | Address Modify | RPLT proc | STOR M(x, 8:19) | Replace the first instruction's operand, of the <i>proc</i> procedure, with the 12 rightmost bits of <i>AC</i>. |
| 0x13 | Address Modify | RPLB proc | STOR M(x, 28:39) | Replace the second instruction's operand, of the <i>proc</i> procedure, with the 12 rightmost bits of <i>AC</i>. |
| 0x14 | Arithmetic | LSH | LSH | Shift <i>AC</i> register one bit to the left. |
| 0x15 | Arithmetic | RSH | RSH | Shift <i>AC</i> register one bit to the right. |
| 0x21 | Data Transfer | STR mem | STOR M(x) | Store <i>AC</i> contents in <i>mem</i>. |

There are a few programs in examples/ folder. Check it out.

# Language

The language that was used was C++.

# Versions

IASpie Alpha v0.1: Initial commit. Some minor error handling messages. Parameters by terminal, one required, up to two: input file, with ".ias" extension, and a optional output file. In case of no output file, the output file will have the same name as the input, with the ".txt" extension. Some Fatal Errors:

* No input file;
* More than two parameters;
* Input file doesn't exist;
* Input file invalid extension;
* Section directives misplaced or missing;
* Instruction placed in data section;
* More than one HALT instruction;
* Bad procedure name, it must begin with "\_" and end with ":";
* Duplicate procedure name;
* Invalid variable value;
* Duplicate variable name;

This program is still in the testing phase. Help in the development, reporting any error to the developer.
